    <p> Counter-Strike: Global Offensive (or CSGO), is a fun competitive shooter game that you and your friends can play together. 
        Most people play competitive which is a 5v5 30 round match, and the first team to 16 wins.
        There are other game options though in CSGO, which to find out more about it, you can click this  <a href= "https://blog.counter-strike.net/" target="_blank"> LINK.</a>

    <p> Dead by Daylight is a fun competitve game that involves teamwork to finish all 5 generators and escape before the killer has enough time to kill everyone.
        You are able to play as the killer, or you and 3 other teammates which are survivors, can go against the killer and try to escape.
        I mainly like to play as survivor, but you can find out more about Dead by Daylight by clicking this <a href= "https://deadbydaylight.com/en" target="_blank"> LINK.</a>
