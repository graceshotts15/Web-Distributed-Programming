    <h1> My Favorite Hobby</h1>
    <p>Hello my name is Grace and my favorite hobby is video games.
      My current favorite games are Dead by Daylight and Counter-Strike: Global Offensive.
      Both of these games are competitive games played with teammates and I am very competitive person.
      My greatest achievement for gaming is getting to the rank Legendary Eagle in Counter-Strike, its a high rank that was hard to get too. 
      I think its easy to be able to make video games as your favorite hobby, just find something you enjoy doing and there are many other games that are similar to what you enjoy.
      I have played games since around 7-8 years old so its something I have done for a really long time, I have created a list of my top games of all time, and I created a chart
      showing the changes in games throughout the years that I have gone through.
