    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    <p class="purple">Hello my name is Grace, I am 21 years old and in my fourth year of college.
      I have 3 older sisters, <br/> me being the youngest of us 4. We also have a dog named Cody, who is a white lab and is about to turn twelve.
      <br/> I am a Computer Science major, without a concentration yet, I am still trying to find out what I want to do.
       I also am<br/> currently not working, I worked at Menards for almost a year but I no longer work there, but I will be finding a job in the near future.
      <br/> I mostly just play video games right now, and my favorite type of music is country, where I am seeing Luke Combs <br/> in concert for the first time in November. I hope to do well in this course and have a good time learning new things! </p>

    <h3>My Favorite Hobby</h3>
    <ol>
      <p> My favorite hobby is of course to play video games. I enjoy playing video games because they are fun to me. 
        Most of my friends<br/> are through video games so its just a time for me to enjoy playing games with my friends. Also my boyfriend serves<br/> in the United States Airforce, so playing video games is a way for us to spend time with each other.
        I do enjoy other things like<br/> driving around and music but video games are definitely my number one favorite thing to do.
         I used to play sports<br/> in summer and high school but when high school ended I didn't continue to play any sports. 
        From time to time I don't mind<br/> playing softball or basketball since those are what I used to do in high school.
